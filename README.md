# Accordion
Accordion is a solitaire game using one deck of playing cards.  The object is to compress the entire deck into one pile like an
accordion.  A pile can be moved on top of another pile immediately to its left or separated to its left by two piles if the top
cards of each pile have the same suit or rank. Gaps left behind are filled by moving remaining piles to the left. Win by having
only one pile left at the end.
